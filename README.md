## Author's Note

<ul>
  <li>I originally wanted to create an extension that would allow the user the dynamically resize and move the extension window, along with a "pin" button which would keep the extension running even when the user clicks somewhere else. These features, however, are not possible to implement in a Chrome web extension.</li>
  <li>TODO: Change the extension icon
</ul>
